### GCP account and project

Make sure that you are in the GCP account and project that you intend to use for this work. In your Linux terminal, type

```bash
gcloud config list
```

The output shows your account and project. 


### Enabling services

## Costs






::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints

- The storage cost depends on the volume stored and for this type of processing is very small. 
- The download of the output files for the bucket has a signicant cost.
