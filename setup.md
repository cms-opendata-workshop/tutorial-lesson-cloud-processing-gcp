## Software setup

In this tutorial, we expect that you will be using a Linux shell on native Linux, macOS or through WSL2 on Windows. If you do have any of them available, you can work through Google Cloud Shell but the instructions in this tutorial are for Linux shell.

You should be familiar with basic Linux shell commands and have `git` available.
